Technical Documentation: 

My project contains 3 different files. I have created one for JAVA, HTML & JS and SQL. 

 

Java: 

I have created a java file that can be run from the console. The idea was to calculate the interest percentage first (using a switch case for the different Agreement Types), then try and do a calculation of the overall interest that was applied to the Starting Amount. 

 

HTML & JS: 

I have created a basic frontend website using html5. I have also tried to add some functionality by using JavaScript. The idea was to use the user input and the do the calculations. I created the Interest Percentage Calculator first by and store those values as variables to later calculate the total interest. 

 

SQL: 

The SQL stored procedure was a bit of a struggle. So, I created a SQL function to calculate a total amount of interest added to a starting amount. I made use of basic input parameters to calculate a new value that can be added to the initial amount.
